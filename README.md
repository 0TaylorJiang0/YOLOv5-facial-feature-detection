# YOLOv5-facial-feature-detection
Hi there 
You should be able to run "takeone.ipynb" after dowloading everything inside folder yolov5.
The folder faces400 contains 400 images, which is a subset of the well-known "lfw" dataset. 
The 400 labeled faces are stored in the YOLO format, which you can directly upload to Roboflow.
(class = ["face", "nose", "mouth", "eye"])
